            <h3>Broad Cast Method</h3>
            <p>This is the most common method of fertilizer application, <br>
                where the fertilizer is spread uniformly over the entire field surface. Broadcasting can be done by hand or with a mechanical spreader.</p>

            <h3>Top Dressing and Side dressing</h3>
            <p>Spreading of fertilizer in standing crops without considering the crop rows is termed as a 
                <br>top dressing. However, when the crop rows are taken into account, 
                and the material is dropped on the ground surface near the crop rows, it is called<br>
                 side dressing.</p>

              <h3>Plough sole placement </h3>
              <p>When the fertilizers are applied in open furrows at plow sole level while plowing,<br>
                 it is termed plow sole placement. Such furrows are covered
                  immediately during the next run of the plow.

              <h3>Surface Irrigation </h3>
              <p>Surface irrigation is a type of irrigation method that involves <br>
                applying water to the soil surface and allowing it to infiltrate and move 
                through the soil by gravity. Surface irrigation can be divided into several subtypes, 
                including:
                <ul>
                    <li>

              <p>SDrip irrigation is a type of irrigation method that involves <br>
                applying water directly to the roots of plants through a network of small tubes 
                or emitters. <br>Drip irrigation systems can be divided into several subtypes, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Point source drip
